            <h3><article class="football-article">Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, with
                whom he won a national
                championship in 1991. He initially aspired for a professional career in football and entered the 1995
                NFL Draft, but he went undrafted. As a result, Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the
                Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle of his first season. Shortly
                after, he began training as a professional wrestler.</article></h3>

            <h3><article class="wrestling-article">In 1996, Johnson secured a contract with the WWF and was promoted as the
                first third-generation
                wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of Rocky Johnson and grandson of Peter Maivia. He
                rose to prominence after developing a charismatic persona of a boastful trash-talking wrestler named The
                Rock. He subsequently won his first WWF Championship in 1998 and helped usher the WWF into the "Attitude
                Era", a boom period in the company's business in the latter 1990s and early 2000s which still hold
                professional wrestling records for television ratings. In 2004, he left the WWE to pursue an acting
                career and went on a seven-year hiatus before returning in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013,
                before wholly retiring in 2019.</article></h3>
